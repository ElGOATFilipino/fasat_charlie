# Fasat_charlie

This is a macropad in the shape of the chilean satelite FASat-CHARLIE. It has 6 keys with a rotary encoder, 16 sk6812mini-e leds on the edges of its pcb and uses kmk firmware.

I made this macropad to help me open the websites I need for school instantly, to record as well as mute! (Since I costantly forget the keybinds for those).

## Features: 
- 16 sk6812mini-e leds, all used for as a "glow" that the macropad emanates in the dark!
- EC11 Rotary encoder /w switch for adjusting led colors and brightness
- 6 keys
- Shape of the FASat-CHARLIE satelite

## CAD
The entire case uses 6 M3x16mm bolts and M3 headseat inserts (4mm deep). 4 are screwed from under the case and the other 2 are used to join the "flag".

The case has 3 separate 3d printed pieces. The bottom, which has a 16 degree inclination so it can face me once I lay it flat on a surface. It also has info. about the fasat charlie on the back. 
The top exposes the pcb so the leds can be seen and has a circular hole where the buttons and rotary encoder will be. 
Lastly, the flag is just a decorative piece that contains acknowlegements.
